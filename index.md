## Building Feedback Systems with OT and CRDTs

## What are Real-Time Streaming Apps?

* Applications where **state updates flow between users instantly**
* Examples: Google Docs, Figma, Miro, Notion comments
* Behave **offline-first**, but **sync-later**, without conflicts
* Core challenges:

  * Concurrent edits
  * Unstable networks
  * Merge conflicts

---

## Two Approaches to Solve This

### 1. **Operational Transform (OT)** ‚Äî *Google Docs era*

### 2. **CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types)** ‚Äî *Modern, offline-first sync*

---

## Operational Transform (OT)

* Clients send **operations** (e.g. "insert at position 5")
* When operations arrive **out of order**, the server applies a *transform function* ‚Üí adjusts an incoming op so it still makes sense after previous edits
* Goal: *All clients apply operations in the **same resulting order** so they converge*

**Example:**

Initial string: `"hello"`

```
User A ‚Üí Insert(1, "X")
User B ‚Üí Insert(3, "Y")
```

Operations arrive at the server in the order: **B**, then **A**

```
apply opB ‚Üí "helYlo"
transform opA to account for opB
(since B inserted a char at position 3, A‚Äôs original "insert at 1" still valid)
apply transformed-A ‚Üí "hXelYlo"
```

> üîß *The "transform" step is a tiny function that modifies position values so the intent of each operation is preserved even when edits happen concurrently.*

---

### OT Strengths

‚úÖ Proven (used in Google Docs, Quill)
‚úÖ Small payloads
‚úÖ Great for strict ordering (code, rich-text)

### OT Drawbacks

‚ùå Usually requires **central server**
‚ùå Hard to support **offline editing**
‚ùå Complex transforms for nested JSON/trees ‚Üí edge-case nightmares

---

## What are CRDTs?

> **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types** ‚Äî data structures that
> **automatically merge** concurrent edits *without needing transforms or a central server*.

* Each operation carries just enough metadata (unique IDs, causal links)
* Replicas exchange operations in **any order**
* Merge logic guarantees that all replicas **eventually converge**

**Example (Sequence CRDT):**

Initial:

```
"h"(A1), "e"(A2), "l"(A3), "l"(A4), "o"(A5)
```

Two users edit concurrently:

```
User A ‚Üí insert "X" after A1
User B ‚Üí insert "Y" after A3
```

CRDT merges based on positions **between IDs**, not absolute indexes ‚Üí order of arrival doesn‚Äôt matter:

```
"h"(A1), "X", "e"(A2), "l"(A3), "Y", "l"(A4), "o"(A5)
‚Üí hXelYlo
```

> üß† *No transform logic required ‚Äî the merge strategy is built into the CRDT data structure itself.*

## Types of CRDT

| Type               | Used For           |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Sequence CRDT      | text streams       |
| JSON/Map CRDT      | docs / objects     |
| Grow-only / OR-Set | basic sets & lists |

Popular libraries:

* **Automerge** ‚Üí JSON CRDT (local-first, JS/Rust)
* **Y.js** ‚Üí text/array/map CRDT (web-scale)
* **Fluid Framework** ‚Üí enterprise Microsoft Loop

---

## Why CRDTs are exciting

‚úÖ Work *offline*: all edits are local
‚úÖ Peer-to-peer capable (WebRTC)
‚úÖ Easy for **React apps** (local state + sync)

---

## But‚Ä¶ CRDTs are not perfect

‚ùå Metadata can grow ‚Üí memory & WS payloads
‚ùå Hard to garbage-collect tombstones
‚ùå Unstable networks ‚Üí constant reconnect/retry logic needed
‚ùå Sync algorithms still evolving

---

## How Do We Implement Real-Time Streaming?

Once we pick **OT** or **CRDT** as our *conflict-resolution model*, we still need a way for nodes to actually **talk to each other**.
This is where the **network transport** comes in.

### üîå WebSockets ‚Äî *Client ‚Üî Server*

> Long-lived TCP channel between browser and central server.

* All updates flow to/from the server
* Easier to scale, works everywhere (firewalls/NATs)
* Common in OT setups like *ShareDB* ‚Äî but CRDTs like *Automerge Repo* can also use it

‚úÖ Simple deployment
‚úÖ Works even on corporate networks
‚ùå Server becomes a bottleneck / single point

Diagram:

```
Browser 1 ‚Üê‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üê‚Üí Server ‚Üê‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üê‚Üí Browser 2
```

---

### üì° WebRTC ‚Äî *Peer ‚Üî Peer*

> Browser-to-browser realtime channel.

* Great for *offline-first CRDT syncing*
* Clients attempt to connect directly ‚Äî if that fails, fall back to a relay
* Requires a *signaling* channel (often still a WebSocket!) to get started

**Needs three pieces of tech:**

| Acronym  | Purpose                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **STUN** | Discover your public IP/port (NAT traversal)        |
| **TURN** | Relay server used *if direct connection fails*      |
| **ICE**  | Algorithm that tries all candidates & picks a route |

‚úÖ True peer-to-peer
‚úÖ Works offline ‚Üí sync when reconnected
‚ùå Harder to debug / NAT punch
‚ùå Still needs signaling infrastructure

Diagram:

```
Browser 1 ‚Üê‚îÄ(signaling over WS)‚îÄ‚Üí Server ‚Üê‚îÄ(signaling over WS)‚îÄ‚Üí Browser 2
‚Üì ICE (STUN/TURN discovery)
Attempts direct P2P connection
```
