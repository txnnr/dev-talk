# Exploring Save File Exploits and Modifications in Pokémon Gold
### Understanding ACE, RCE, and Memory Structures

![title-photo](images/home.jpg)

---

# What Are We Doing?

- Demonstrating save file manipulation in Pokémon Gold.
- Topics covered:
  - **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** Running custom code.
  - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Executing code externally.
  - **Memory Structure:** Understanding offsets and targeted data edits.

**Practical Applications:**
- Changing in-game money.
- Ensuring save file integrity with checksums.
- Automating repetitive modifications.

# Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)

- **Definition:** Running custom code by exploiting memory or save file vulnerabilities.
- **How It Works:**
  - ACE exploits unused or mismanaged areas of memory.
  - Redirects the game’s logic to execute unintended code paths.

---

# Tools for Performing Arbitrary Code Execution

### **1. Hex Editors**
- **Examples:**  
  - Hex Fiend (Mac).
  - HxD (Windows).  
- **Usage:**  
  - Manually locate and modify offsets within save files or executables.

---

### **2. Memory Debuggers**
- **Examples:**  
  - Cheat Engine: Analyze live memory states in games.
  - Ghidra: Analyze and modify program execution at runtime.
- **Usage:**  
  - Redirect execution to unintended code paths.
  - Dynamically test memory modifications.

---

### **3. Exploit Development Frameworks**
- **Examples:**  
  - GDB (GNU Debugger): Debug and manipulate binaries.
  - IDA Pro: Disassemble and understand program structure.
- **Usage:**  
  - Reverse engineer and develop custom code execution strategies.

# Remote Code Execution (RCE)

- **Definition:** Executing code on a system using external tools or data sources.
- **How It Differs From ACE:**
  - ACE occurs locally within the game or system.
  - RCE involves external inputs like save editors or emulators.

---

# Tools for Performing Remote Code Execution

### **1. Save File Editors**
- **Examples:**  
  - PKHeX: Edit Pokémon save files.
  - GameShark/Action Replay: Modify in-game memory via external devices.
- **Usage:**  
  - Directly inject or modify data in save files or memory blocks.

---

### **2. Emulators**
- **Examples:**  
  - VisualBoyAdvance: Load save files and test modifications.
  - RetroArch: Integrate with tools for debugging and testing.
- **Usage:**  
  - Load modified save files to validate changes.
  - Test custom patches in a controlled environment.

---

### **3. Scripting Tools**
- **Examples:**  
  - Python (e.g., save file automation).
  - Bash/PowerShell for bulk file edits.
  - IDA to decompile and edit.
- **Usage:**  
  - Automate remote modifications across multiple files.
  - Validate and deploy patches efficiently.

# How Memory Works in Save Files

- **Memory as a Data Grid:**
  - Save files are structured like a grid of memory addresses.
  - Each address (or offset) stores specific pieces of data. 

  Eg) in the string `abcdef` you would say the character `d` has an offset of 3 from the beginning of the object `a`.

---

# Endianness and Data Decoding

### **Endianness**
- **Definition:** Refers to the order in which bytes are stored in memory.
- **Little Endian:**
  - Least significant byte (LSB - right most number) stored first.
  - Used in Pokémon Gold's save file.

---

# Checksums and Validation

### **What is a Checksum?**
- **Definition:** A numerical value calculated from a block of data to ensure integrity.
- **Purpose:**  
  - Detects accidental changes to data.  
  - Used in save files to validate that data hasn’t been corrupted.

---

# Key Takeaways

- **ACE and RCE:**  
  - Enable precise, targeted changes to memory for custom functionality.
  - Highlight the importance of securing systems against unintended code execution.

- **Memory Structures and Endianness:**  
  - Understanding how data is stored (e.g., offsets and endianness) is critical for manipulating files and debugging.

- **Data Integrity:**  
  - Checksums provide a real-world mechanism to ensure data consistency and validate file integrity.

- **Relevance Beyond Gaming:**  
  - These concepts apply to web development, data validation, security, & database optimization/design practices.
